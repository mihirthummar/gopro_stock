# I made this program because I own 1 stock of GoPro
Python program that provides several features about the GoPro Stock:
  1)Shows the current day's open, high, low, and close prices along with the volume of stock traded
  2)Finds the 100 day moving average for each day since the GoPro IPO
  3)Uses machine learning and regression analysis to predict future GoPro stock prices and tests the accuracy of such a prediction method
  4) Currently adding more machine learning and prediction techniques to this program
